# Project: Unity REST API Integration

[![Project Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GIxu8kA9EBU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIxu8kA9EBU)

This project was developed as part of my coursework for the Software Construction and Decision Making class at Tec de Monterrey. My name is Arturo Dur√°n Castillo, and I am currently in my fourth semester of the ITC (Information Technology and Communications) program.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to integrate a REST API into Unity, a popular game development engine. By leveraging the power of RESTful web services, we aimed to create a seamless connection between our Unity application and a backend server, enabling data retrieval and manipulation.

Using the tutorial provided by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIxu8kA9EBU), we followed step-by-step instructions to build an interactive Unity project that interacts with a REST API. This tutorial served as a valuable resource, guiding us through the process of integrating RESTful functionality into our game development workflow.

## Technologies Used

- Unity game development engine
- REST API for backend communication
- C# scripting language for Unity development
